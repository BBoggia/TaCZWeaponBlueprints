# Changelog

## 1.0.3-beta7 - 2026-08-24

### Added

- Authoritative TaCZ 1.1.5 blueprint catalog discovery for guns, ammunition, and attachments.
- Persistent, validated, server-authoritative learned-recipe progression.
- Server-side TaCZ crafting enforcement and bounded deterministic synchronization.
- Durable blueprint-output unlock identities with automatic duplicate-recipe alias migration.
- Byte-budgeted atomic synchronization chunks below Minecraft's custom-payload ceiling.
- Live configuration-aware loot selection and all three blacklist categories.
- Versioned, reloadable blueprint tags, loot pools, and loot rules.
- Pool inheritance, catalog selectors, loot-table selectors, and dimension/luck predicates.
- Atomic last-known-good catalog and loot snapshot publication.
- Operator status, inspection, pool, and analytical preview commands.
- Exact effective weights, per-roll probabilities, and expected-addition reporting.
- Automated tests and packaged-release verification.

### Changed

- Replaced TaCZ recipe-ID path guessing with result-item API resolution.
- Replaced global client/server catalog state with isolated authoritative and presentation catalogs.
- Replaced reflection-driven loot resource discovery with strict deterministic loading.
- Made generated legacy loot modifiers a table-selective compatibility fallback behind dynamic rules.
- Limited blueprint additions to one shared 64-item budget per loot event.
- Tightened declared compatibility to TaCZ `[1.1.5,1.2)` and Fzzy Config `[0.5.9,0.6)`.
- Tightened Minecraft to `[1.20.1,1.20.2)` and Forge/FML to `[47,48)`.
- Made archive ordering and timestamps reproducible.

### Fixed

- Content-pack namespaces being incorrectly treated as Forge mod IDs.
- Blueprint consumption on duplicate or invalid unlocks.
- Lost unlocks during player cloning, including return from the End.
- Client catalog synchronization overwriting integrated-server authority.
- Stale learned IDs exhausting or polluting active synchronization.
- Malformed optional datapack fields silently applying defaults.
- Partial reload publication, inheritance cycles, unsafe weights, and unbounded definitions.
- Multiple overlapping modifiers independently exceeding the per-event blueprint limit.
- Optional structure dependencies breaking the normal dedicated-server development runtime.
- Canonical duplicate recipes invalidating previously learned aliases.
- Maximum-count synchronization payloads exceeding Minecraft's byte limit.
- Selector inheritance underflow escaping reload validation.
- Removed content-pack blueprints rendering invisibly and spamming client logs.
- Open gun-smithing screens retaining stale unlock/configuration state.
- Translation overrides being interpreted as unsafe Java format strings.
- Targeted disabled loot rules being reported as a global datapack opt-out.
- Removed 69 orphaned legacy modifier files that were not referenced by the
  global loot-modifier index and therefore could never execute.

### Compatibility

- Existing valid player `Recipes` NBT remains readable and is migrated into durable `Blueprints` state.
- Format-1 loot pools and rules remain supported.
- The 485 generated legacy modifiers remain packaged for incremental migration and rollback.
- Existing six-tier weights and authored table overlaps are unchanged.
